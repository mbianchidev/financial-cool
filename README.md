# Cool financial communities, tools and products

Financial cool is a list of communities, tools, books, products and everything useful that can be found online revolving around finance, with a focus on personal finance and retail investing.
You won't find the Bloomberg terminal listed here, but you will find a lot of useful tools to help you with your personal finance journey.

The repository intends to give visibility to these tools and stimulate the community to use them and, why not, to growing the personal finance ecosystem.

!! Invest at your own risk, do your research before buying any product. Remember that any promise of high hield in the short term is either too risky or a lie.
